Objectives: - 
Part 1: Establish Basic Connections Devices Via Network Wire.
Part 2: Using The Established Basic Connection, Run Commands In CMD prompt
Part 3: Establish Basic Connections Devices Using Network Wire Via Switch.
Part 4: Implement Bus, Star & Ring Topologies.


Background / Scenario
We will look into how we can connect computers/laptops using a virtual program called CISCO Packet Tracer. It can help us share files among the systems easily. A virtual program is used to set up the appropriate connection as it gives us a brief idea about the requirements for establishing a physical connection like hubs, switches, and routers


Part 1: Establish Basic Connections Devices Via Network Wire.
Instructions
Step 1: Download Cisco Packet Tracer.
Step 2: Run and install the setup (You can be requested to log in to your Cisco Networking Academy Account or you can also log in as a guest).
Step 3: After the installation procedure has completed this display (below) will appear when you run the Cisco Packet Tracer-Start the application.

Step 4: From the bottom toolbar, click on ‘End Devices’ and select ‘PC’ and then click on the screen (for two PC’s do this step twice).

Step 5: Now to connect the PC’s, we require a wire; we use cross-over wire to connect similar devices.

Step 6: After selecting the wire click on the computer on the screen(here PC0) and select FastEthernet0.
Then, drag the wire to the other pc and do the same.

Step 7: Now, we will assign the IP address to both the PCs and Now in IPv4 Address, write 192.168.1.2 and 192.168.1.3 and We have successfully connected two computers.

Now to check this, we will transfer data from one computer to another and check whether the transfer is successful or not. To do so follow the below steps:

Step 1: From the Secondary Toolbar at the top, select ‘Add simple PDU’ that is the second last icon.

 



Step 2: Now click on PC0 and then PC1. 

 

Now if in Realtime box- PDU list window it shows successful, that means all the connections are correct and the data transfer is successful

 

You have successfully connected two computers, using the virtual program Cisco Packet Tracer.


Part 2: Using The Established Basic Connection, Run Commands In CMD prompt

Instructions
Step 1: Use the established connections between two PC’s.
Step 1: Click On PC0 Or PC.
Step 1: Click On Desktop.
Step 1: Then Go To CMD Prompt.
Step 1: Execute Commands: - tracert <ip_address_of_other_pc>, ipconfig /all, ipconfig, ping <ip_address_of_other_pc>


 

 

 

Part 3: Establish Basic Connections Devices Using Network Wire Via Switch.

Instructions
Step 1: Download Cisco Packet Tracer.
Step 2: Run and install the setup (You can be requested to log in to your Cisco Networking Academy Account or you can also log in as a guest).
Step 3: After the installation procedure has completed this display (below) will appear when you run the Cisco Packet Tracer-Start the application.

 

Step 4: From the bottom toolbar, click on ‘End Devices’ and select ‘PC’ and then click on the screen (for two PC’s do this step twice).


 

Step 5: Now to connect the PC’s, we require a wire; we use cross-over wire to connect similar devices. But the wires will be connecting the PC’s indirectly through a switch.

 


Step 6: After the connection is established then we will be assigning a IP address of our choice.

 
 

 


 

Now to check this, we will transfer data from one computer to another and check whether the transfer is successful or not. To do so follow the below steps:

Step 1: From the Secondary Toolbar at the top, select ‘Add simple PDU’ that is the second last icon.

 



Step 2: Now click on PC0 and then PC1. 

 

Now if in Realtime box- PDU list window it shows successful, that means all the connections are correct and the data transfer is successful

 

You have successfully connected two computers via switch, using the virtual program Cisco Packet Tracer.


Part 4: Implement Bus, Star & Ring Topologies.

Steps Implementing Star Topology using Cisco Packet Tracer: 
Step 1: We have taken a switch and linked it to six end devices.
Step 2: Link every device with the switch.
Step 3: Provide the IP address to each device.
Step 4: Transfer message from one device to another and check the Table for Validation.

 


 




Steps Implementing Bus Topology using Cisco Packet Tracer: 
Step 1: First, open the cisco packet tracer desktop and select the devices
Step 2: Connect the PC’s with Switches Via Automatically Choose Connection Type.
Step 3: Configure the PCs (hosts) with IPv4 address.
Step 4: If You Want To Verify, Then Use Simple PDU.
Step 5: The Bus Topology Connection Is Established.

 
Steps Implementing Ring Topology using Cisco Packet Tracer: 
Step 1: First, open the cisco packet tracer desktop and select the devices
Step 2: Connect the PC’s with Switches Via Automatically Choose Connection Type.
Step 3: Configure the PCs (hosts) with IPv4 address.
Step 4: If You Want To Verify, Then Use Simple PDU.
Step 5: The Ring Topology Connection Is Established.
